# Jupyter notebook

This directory contains content best viewed with Jupyterlab.
The library requirements are part of the `Pipfile` so if you have
already run

```python
pipenv shell
```

Then all you have to do is start Jupyterlab running `analysis.nb`

```shell
jupyter lab analysis.nb
```

You can view the notebook directly too:
[analysis.nb](https://github.com/tanyaschlusser/15-years-pycon/blob/master/analysis/analysis.nb).
