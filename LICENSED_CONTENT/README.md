## visualization/data/world.png and visualization/data/world.svg
  are created from the shapefile made by Bjorn Sandvik, available at

  When using the derived png and svg files, no further attribution to
  us is necessary; just please make the required link to Sandvik's work.
  We used Mike Bostock's topojson to process the shapefile, and the d3.js
  [GeoTimes projection](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo-projection#geoTimes)
  to make the SVG.  The SVG was cropped in GIMP so the pixels don't
  line up with the original; this is why latlon transformations in the
  Processing code for the cities where PyCons are held have an extra shift.
  Sorry.
