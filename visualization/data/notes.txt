In 2003, Python was already 14 years old, there were annual conferences in Europe,
and the International Python Conference had been held 10 times in the United States.
Too expensive for hobbyists or academics, Python enthusiasts decided to hold
a community-organized conference of their own at George Washington University:
PyCon was born.

This poster groups talks by their primary category, but talks usually
span multiple categories (e.g. A web app that serves a dashboard presenting
model results processed in parallel over a cluster.)
Quantity of talks seem to indicate community innovation rather
than interest: typically it seems like 1-3 years after a new
concept or tool is introduced, it makes it into a PyCon talk.
Talks continue for a couple of years, and then 
then the discussion quiets down.
